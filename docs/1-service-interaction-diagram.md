# Architecture Exercise - Service Interaction Diagram

Here is a service interaction diagram, this will hopefully form the basis of the discussion for how I understood the services and how they would interact given the tech involved.

## Security

Immediate thoughts around security there is no identity provider or IDP. Would like to see anything in a B2C/B2B context. Okta/Auth0/AzureAD/SAML/OAuth/LDAP/PAM.

## Scalability

Not adddressed by this diagram but I highly recommend we start with the [network diagram](2-network-architecture-diagram.md) next if this is where the discussion goes next. 

## Maintainability

This cost of this without a proper IDP is very expensive at an enterprise level, what you trade off now, you will have to build later. It could cause a seismic shift with the long tail of migrations in the product or platform. 

## Cost Effectiveness

Although this would naively work in a stealth startup, it simply would not scale. I think it is an illusion when businesses start getting passed the scale-up phase and start pursuing postitive revenue/growth. Cost will be an issue down the line esp. with custom installations.
